// READ BEFORE YOU START:
// This program begins by displaying a menu to the user with options to add a movie, delete a movie, and search for a movie in a list. Your job is to implement the 
// add(), search(), recommendation(), and delete_one() functions. Each has specific instructions included in comments above of the function. You will be doing all
// of this using a linked list, unlike in hw05 where you were using an array of structures. You should begin by tracing the helper function that is already 
// implemented for you. Not only will this help you in understanding how to define and use pointers, it will help you understand what this program does. 
// You should not change any of the code that you are given, only implement code where you are asked.

// Similar to hw05, you will be inserting into a list of movies sorted by their rating.

// "list" is initialized as NULL. Use this as your 'head' of the list and insert into it accordingly.

//	- inserting into an empty list
//	- inserting at the beginning of the list
//	- inserting inbetween 2 nodes in the list
//	- inserting at the end of the list
// The short segment of code is given to you to help you get started. You will need to define new variables and pointers as needed.
//
// If a movie with the same rating already exists in the list, you should replace that position with the new movie, and move that movie to the next position.
//
// For example, if you have the list that contains:
//
//	Movie: The Hunger Games
//	Rating: 8
//
//	Movie: Mission Impossible
//	Rating: 7
//
// And you were to add the movie "The Sound of Music" with a rating of 8, your new list should be:
//
//	Movie: The Sound of Music
//	Rating: 8
//
//	Movie: The Hunger Games
//	Rating: 8
//
//	Movie: Mission Impossible
//	Rating: 7
