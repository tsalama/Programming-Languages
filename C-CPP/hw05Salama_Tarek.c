// This homework exercise array of structures and their operations, flush, and file

// READ BEFORE YOU START:
// This program begins by displaying a menu to the user with options to add a movie, display the list, or quit and save the list. Your job is to implement the 
// add(), display(), save(), and load() functions. Each has specific instructions included in comments above the scope of the function. A few things to consider 
// are that you are given a global integer named count and an integer max defined in main. Use count to keep track of the amount of movies are stored in your list.
// max is the maximum amount of movies that you can store in your list. It is important for you to use these accordingly. Calling save() and load() has already been
// implemented for you. You only need to complete the function. You should not change any of the code that you are given, only implement code where you are asked.

//	Q1: add (30)
//	This function is used to insert a new movie name (char* movie_name) and rating (int rating) into your list.
//	Your list of movies should be sorted by rating, so you need to search for the correct index to add into your list.
//  (index 0 should be the highest rated movie, index 1 should be the 2nd highest rated movie, etc.)
//  Use the global integer variable "count" to keep track of how many movies you have in your list.
//
//  In main, 'max' is defined as the maximum total amount of movies that you can store in your list. 'max' has been passed to this function, use it accordingly.
//	Use 'max' so that if you were to change the value of max, your program would work the same (graders will change max for testing your sort).
//	You can change the value of 'max' in main in order to test your code.
//
//	If a movie is entered with a rating that is too low to make the list, print: "\nThis movie is not one of your favorites!\n\n".
//	(hint: you should increase count for each movie you add, but not if you are adding to a list that already contains the 'max' amount of movies)
//
//  You are not required to use pointer operations for your list but you may do so if you'd like. list/max are only passed to this function for testing purposes.
//
//	If a movie with the same rating already exists in the list, you should replace that index with the new movie, and move that movie to the next index.
//
//	For example, if you have the list that contains:
//
//		Movie: The Hunger Games
//		Rating: 8
//
//		Movie: Mission Impossible
//		Rating: 7
//
//	And you were to add the movie "The Sound of Music" with a rating of 8, your new list should be:
//
//		Movie: The Sound of Music
//		Rating: 8
//
//		Movie: The Hunger Games
//		Rating: 8
//
//		Movie: Mission Impossible
//		Rating: 7
//
//  (Unless max is set to 2, then it would just contain the 2 highest rated movies)
