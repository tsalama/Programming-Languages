// READ BEFORE YOU START:
// This homework is built on homework 06. The given program is an updated version of hw06 solution. It begins by displaying a menu to the user 
// with the add() function from the last homework, as well as some new options: add an actor/actress to a movie, display a list of movies for 
// an actor/actress, delete all movies, display all movies, display a movie by index, and display a list of movies by genre. Your job is to 
// implement the delete_all(), print_by_index(), print_by_genre(), add_actor(), and find_actor() functions. Each has specific instructions 
// included in comments above of the function. A new struct has been inlcuded, which you will use to create a linked list of actors for each 
// movie in your list. You should begin by tracing the helper2 and print_helper functions that are already implemented for you. Not only will 
// this help you in understanding how to define and use pointers, it will help you understand what this program does. You should not change any 
// of the code that you are given, only implement code where you are asked. You may assume that no 2 movies will have the same name.
